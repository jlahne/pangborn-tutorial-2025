# The basics of plotting with `ggplot2`
  
```{r setup-3, echo=FALSE, purl = FALSE, include=FALSE}

```

Base `R` includes extremely powerful utilities for data visualization, but most modern applications make use of the `tidyverse` package `ggplot2`.

A quick word about base `R` plotting--I don't mean to declare that you can't use base `R` plotting for your projects at all, and I have published several papers using base `R` plots.  Particularly as you are using `R` for your own data exploration (not meant for sharing outside your team, say), base utilities like `plot()` will be very useful for quick insight. 

`ggplot2` provides a standardized, programmatic interface for data visualization, in contrast to the piecemeal approach common to base `R` graphics plotting.  This means that, while the syntax itself can be challenging to learn, syntax for different tasks is linked by a common vocabulary, and differs in logical and predictable ways.

Together with other `tidyverse` principles (like `select()` and `filter()` approaches), `ggplot2` makes it easy to make publication-quality visualizations with relative ease.

In general, `ggplot2` works best with data in "long" or "tidy" format, such as that resulting from the output of `pivot_longer()`.  The 

The schematic elements of a ggplot are as follows:

```{r non-working schematic of a ggplot, eval = FALSE}
# The ggplot() function creates your plotting environment.  We usually save it to a variable in R so that we can use the plug-n-play functionality of ggplot without retyping a bunch of nonsense
p <- ggplot(mapping = aes(x = <a variable>, y = <another variable>, ...),
            data = <your data>)

# Then, you can add various ways of plotting data to make different visualizations.
p + 
  geom_<your chosen way of plotting>(...) +
  theme_<your chosen theme> +
  ...
```

In graphical form, the following diagram ([from VT Professor JP Gannon](https://vt-hydroinformatics.github.io/Plotting.html#our-first-ggplot)) gives an intuition of what is happening:

![Basic ggplot mappings.  Color boxes indicate where the elements go in the function and in the plot.](img/GGplot syntax.png)

## Your first `ggplot()`

Our cider data is already relatively tidy and is much easier to visually inspect, so we will be primarily using it in this section.  

Let's begin by making an example `ggplot()` to demonstrate how it works.  We will focus on the cider CA coordinates so that we can build up a somewhat meaningful plot.

```{r a first ggplot}
# We start with our data and pipe it into ggplot
ca_cider_coords %>%
  # Here we set up the base plot
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = `Dim 1`, y = `Dim 2`)) + 
   # Here we tell our base plot to add points
  geom_point()                          
```

This doesn't look all that impressive--partly because the data being plotted itself isn't sensible without other context that exists in the data frame, and partly because we haven't made many changes.  But before we start looking into that, let's break down the parts of this command.

## The `aes()` function and `mapping = ` argument

The `ggplot()` function takes two arguments that are essential, as well as some others you'll rarely use.  The first, `data = `, is straightforward, and you'll usually be passing data to the function at the end of some pipeline using `%>%`

The second, `mapping = `, is less clear.  This argument requires the `aes()` function, which can be read as the "aesthetic" function.  The way that this function works is quite complex, and really not worth digging into here, but I understand it in my head as **telling `ggplot()` what part of my data is going to connect to what part of the plot**.  So, if we write `aes(x = `Dim 1`)`, we can read this in our heads as "the values of x will be mapped from the 'Dim 1' column". 

> NB: The use of the `\`` character in `\`Dim 1\`` is because the name is technically "non-syntactic": it has a space in it.  `R` allows us to save objects with names that violate the rules--containing whitespace (` `), starting with a number character, or including characters like `(`, `)`, `$`, etc by using the `\`` operators.  The `{tidyverse}` functions do this automatically.

This sentence tells us the other important thing about `ggplot()` and the `aes()` mappings: **mapped variables each have to be in their own column**.  This is another reason that `ggplot()` requires tidy data. 

## Adding layers with `geom_*()` functions

In the above example, we added (literally, using `+`) a function called `geom_point()` to the base `ggplot()` call.  This is functionally a "layer" of our plot, that tells `ggplot2` how to actually visualize the elements specified in the `aes()` function--in the case of `geom_point()`, we create a point for each row's combination of `x = MerlynScale_Ranking` and `y = Liking`.

```{r what we are plotting in this example}
ca_cider_coords %>% 
  select(`Dim 1`, `Dim 2`)
```

There are many `geom_*()` functions in `ggplot2`, and many others defined in other accessory packages.  These are the heart of visualizations.  We can swap them out to get different results:

```{r switching geom switches the way the data map}
ca_cider_coords %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = `Dim 1`, y = `Dim 2`)) + 
  # connecting our points with a line makes even less sense
  geom_line()
```
The default `geom_line()` behavior is to connect points ordered by the column that is assigned to `x = ` in the `aes()` function.

We can also combine layers, as the term "layer" implies:

```{r geoms are layers in a plot}
ca_cider_coords %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = `Dim 1`, y = `Dim 2`)) + 
  geom_point() +
  # add a layer with the names of the points
  geom_text(mapping = aes(label = name))
```

Note that we don't need to tell *either* `geom_point()` or `geom_text()` what `x` and `y` are--they "inherit" them from the `ggplot()` function to which they are added (`+`), which defines the plot itself.  But we did need to give a *new* mapping--`label = name`--to the `geom_text()` layer, which tells it which column to get the labels for each point.

What other arguments can be set to aesthetics?  Well, we can set other visual properties like **color**, **size**, **transparency** (called "alpha"), and so on.  Let's go ahead and color the different points and labels by whether they are ciders or CATA descriptors--whether they are rows or columns in the original contingency table.

```{r here are some other parts of the plot we can control with data}
ca_cider_coords %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = `Dim 1`, y = `Dim 2`, color = type)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(mapping = aes(label = name))
```

Notice again that we don't have to specify our color inside each label--because we define this "aesthetic" at the level of the plot in the `ggplot()` function all layers that can use it will "inherit" it.

If we want to only color a single layer, we have a couple options.  The simplest is simply to define the mapping only at the layer level, not the plot level.

```{r color only one layer}
ca_cider_coords %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = `Dim 1`, y = `Dim 2`)) + 
  # we will only color the points, not the text
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = type)) +
  geom_text(mapping = aes(label = name))
```


## Arguments inside and outside of `aes()`

In the above plots, we are obviously unhappy with the position of the text in regards to the points: we are overplotting!  What if we wanted to move our text so that it's not centered on the $(x,y)$ point?  (We will see a better way to do this automatically later.)

```{r}
ca_cider_coords %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = `Dim 1`, y = `Dim 2`)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = type)) +
  geom_text(mapping = aes(label = name),
            hjust = "outward",
            color = "darkblue")
```

Here we set two aesthetics that *could* be in the `aes()` function and tied to data, but that we want to only set to a single value: we want all of our text to be `"darkblue"` (sure, why not?) and we use the `hjust = "outward"` text alignment option to push our text away from the center of the plot and thus not to overplot our points.  

Here I will also note that manual text adjustment is usually not the best approach with text-heavy scatterplots such as are common in sensory science biplots.  We will usually prefer to use an automatic approach for adjusting text position from the `{ggrepel}` package.  We can either load `{ggrepel}` directly using `library(ggrepel)` or we can use the `::` syntax to access an installed function without loading the entire namespace.

```{r showing ggrepel}
ca_cider_coords %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = `Dim 1`, y = `Dim 2`)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = type)) +
  # here we opt for not loading the package
  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(mapping = aes(label = name),
            color = "darkblue") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange", "darkgreen"))
```

### Using `theme_*()` to change visual options quickly

In the last several plots, notice that we are using the default (and to my mind unattractive) grey background of `ggplot2`.  If this tutorial had a single goal, it would be to eliminate this theme from published papers.  It looks *bad* (and tends to reduce contrast).

```{r adding a different theme}
ca_cider_coords %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = `Dim 1`, y = `Dim 2`)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = type)) +
  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(mapping = aes(label = name),
            color = "darkblue") +
  # here we switch to a black and white theme
  theme_bw()
```

We can easily get rid of the grey by adding a `theme_bw()` call to the list of commands.  `ggplot2` includes a number of default `theme_*()` functions, and you can get many more through other `R` packages.  They can have subtle to dramatic effects:

```{r using the theme functions}
ca_cider_coords %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = `Dim 1`, y = `Dim 2`)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = type)) +
  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(mapping = aes(label = name),
            color = "darkblue") + 
  theme_void()
```

The `theme_*()` functions are complete sets of plot background options.  You can edit every last element of the plot's theme using the base `theme()` function, which is powerful but a little bit tricky to use.

```{r using theme}
ca_cider_coords %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = `Dim 1`, y = `Dim 2`)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = type)) +
  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(mapping = aes(label = name),
            color = "darkblue") + 
  theme_bw() + 
  # we use theme() to remove grid lines and move the legend, for example
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "bottom")
```

Many calls to `theme()` involve `element_*()` functions.  When we remove elements, for example, we use `element_blank()` (not, for example, `NA` or `NULL` as we typically would in other parts of `R`).

When we want to change how our text is formatted (not the values, but the formatting), we use `element_text()` calls.

```{r element_text}
ca_cider_coords %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = `Dim 1`, y = `Dim 2`)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = type)) +
  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(mapping = aes(label = name),
            color = "darkblue") +
  theme_bw() + 
  # let's make the axis titles bold and the labels serif-font
  theme(axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
        axis.text = element_text(family = "serif"))
```

Finally, we can set default themes for a particular script using the `theme_set()` function.  We can also use this to set custom defaults:

```{r setting the default theme then making a ggplot}
theme_set(
  theme_bw() + 
    theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
)

ca_cider_coords %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = `Dim 1`, y = `Dim 2`)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = type)) +
  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(mapping = aes(label = name),
            color = "darkblue")
```

All plots from here on in the script will *default* to the `theme_bw()` theme, with the "minor" grid lines removed for a cleaner grid look.

### Changing aesthetic elements with `scale_*()` functions

Finally, say we didn't like the default color set for the points.  

How can we manipulate the colors that are plotted?  The **way in which** mapped, aesthetic variables are assigned to visual elements is controlled by the `scale_*()` functions.  

In my experience, the most frequently encountered scales are those for color: either `scale_fill_*()` for solid objects (like the bars in a histogram) or `scale_color_*()` for lines and points (like the outlines of the histogram bars, or the points and letters in our scatterplots so far).  

Scale functions work by telling `ggplot()` *how* to map aesthetic variables to visual elements.  You may have noticed that I added a `scale_color_manual()` function to the end of several plots above.  This function lets me manually specify the colors that are assigned to each colored element.


```{r ggplots are R objects}
p <- 
  ca_cider_coords %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = `Dim 1`, y = `Dim 2`, color = type)) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(mapping = aes(label = name), 
                           # this command stops this layer from being added to
                           # the legend, to make it look cleaner
                           show.legend = FALSE)

p
```

We can take a saved plot (like `p`) and use scales to change how it is visualized.

```{r we can modify stored plots after the fact}
p + scale_color_viridis_d()
```

`ggplot2` has a broad range of built-in options for scales, but there are many others available in add-on packages that build on top of it.  The `scale_*_viridis_*()` functions use a package callled `viridis` that provides (theoretically) color-blind safe colors for both continuous (gradient) and categorical (discrete) mappings, but I do find that their defaults (using light colors like yellow on one end of the scale) are hard to see for anyone!

As we saw above, you can also build your own scales using the `scale_*_manual()` functions, in which you give a vector of the same length as your mapped aesthetic variable in order to set up the visual assignment.  That sounds jargon-y, so here is an example:

```{r another example of posthoc plot modification}
# We'll pick 14 random colors from the colors R knows about

p + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("wheat", "darkviolet"))
```

### Finally, `facet_*()`

So far we've seen how to visualize the overall configuration of our ciders by their CATA attributes using a Correspondence Analysis.  These results are, of course, based on an underlying contingency table:

```{r cider contingency table}
cider_contingency
```

A natural visualization to quickly assess CATA results is of course a bar plot.

```{r}
cider_contingency %>% 
  as_tibble(rownames = "sample") %>%
  pivot_longer(-sample) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = name, y = value, fill = sample)) + 
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) + 
  # coord_*() functions affect how the axes are plotted;
  # coord_flip() switches the x- and y-axes
  coord_flip()
```

This is obviously not ideal for visualization: 

1. It is hard to see the bars.
2. CA plots are driven by ratios, so it would be good to see differences based on rates of endorsement for CATA per-attribute, not overall (common attributes swamp uncommon attributes).

The last powerful tool I want to show off is the ability of `ggplot2` to make what [Edward Tufte called "small multiples"](https://socviz.co/groupfacettx.html#facet-to-make-small-multiples): breaking out the data into multiple, identical plots by some categorical classifier in order to show trends more effectively.

```{r cider-facets}
cider_contingency %>% 
  as_tibble(rownames = "sample") %>%
  pivot_longer(-sample) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sample, y = value)) + 
  geom_col(aes(fill = sample)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = wesanderson::wes_palettes$AsteroidCity2) + 
  coord_flip() + 
  facet_wrap(~name, ncol = 6) + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, fill = NULL) + 
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```

We can see that overall for the most frequently used attributes, the serving temperature doesn't matter (and for the most part there is some reassuring consistency in the use of terms to describe each cider at different temperatures).

But in the previous part of this workshop, we showed much more complex plots for our berry data, which showed the same plot broken up by a classifying variable: this is called "faceting".  Let's return from our cider data to our berry data in order to finally complete the workflow I showed in the beginning of the workshop.

Now we are prepared to walk through the entire workflow:

```{r berry-penalty-plots}
# First we wrangle our data using the tools we've learned to get penalties/lifts
# for each attributes
berry_penalty_analysis_data <- 
  berry_long_cata %>%
  group_by(berry, cata_variable, checked) %>%
  summarize(penalty_lift = mean(rating),
            count = n()) %>%
  ungroup() 

p1_berry_penalty <- 
  
  # We start by widening our data just a bit, and use a function to give some
  # better names to our mean values for when an attribute it checked (1) or not
  # (0).
  
  berry_penalty_analysis_data %>%
  select(-count) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = checked,
              values_from = penalty_lift,
              names_prefix = "checked_") %>%
  
  # Then we actually calculate the penalty/lift: what is the difference in the
  # mean liking when an attribute is checked or not?
  
  group_by(berry, cata_variable) %>%
  summarize(penalty_lift = checked_1 - checked_0) %>%
  
  # We have two kinds of CATA attibutes: visual assessment and by-mouth
  # assessment.  It would be nice to keep track.
  
  separate(cata_variable, 
           into = c("mode", "variable"), 
           sep = "_") %>%
  
  # Fix a typo
  
  mutate(mode = str_replace(mode, "appearane", "appearance")) %>%
  mutate(mode = case_when(mode == "taste" ~ "(T)",
                          mode == "appearance" ~ "(A)")) %>%
  unite(variable, mode, col = "cata_variable", sep = " ") %>%
  
  # We are using a function from tidytext that makes faceting the final figure
  # easier: reorder_within() makes a set of factors able to be ordered
  # differently within another variable.  In this case, we have different
  # attributes and different penalties within each berry by design
  
  mutate(cata_variable = tidytext::reorder_within(x = cata_variable,
                                                  by = penalty_lift,
                                                  within = berry)) %>%
  
  #And finally we plot!
  
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = cata_variable, y = penalty_lift)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = penalty_lift), color = "white", show.legend = FALSE) + 
  facet_wrap(~berry, scales = "free", nrow = 1) + 
  
  # To take advantage of our newly reordered factors, we also need to use the
  # matching tidytext::scale_x_reordered() function
  
  tidytext::scale_x_reordered() + 
  coord_flip() + 
  theme_classic() + 
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "tan", high = "darkgreen") + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL,
       title = "Penalty / Lift Analysis",
       subtitle = "displays the mean difference (within berries) for when a CATA variable is checked\nor un-checked")

# Let's save it so we can come back to it later:
save(p1_berry_penalty, file = "data/goal-plot.RData")

p1_berry_penalty
```

We can see that the 2 most important attributes for driving liking are the same across all 4 berries, but that the highest penalty is different across them.

## Some further reading

This has been a lightning tour of `ggplot2` as preparatory material; it barely scratches the surface.  We're going to dig into some further tools that you can use for common sensory visualizations, but we've learned all of these tricks from the following resources (as well as a lot of work on Stack Overflow/Exchange):
