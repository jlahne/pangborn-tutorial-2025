# Data visualization basics with `ggplot2`

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel)
berry_data <- read_csv("data/clt-berry-data.csv")
```

## Built-in plots with the ca package

Normally, we present CA results as a graph. You can use the base R `plot()` function *directly* on the output of `ca()` for quick results.

```{r base R plotting example}
plot(berry_ca_res)
```

You can learn some things from this already: Strawberries 1 & 2 had some appearance defects that made them noticably different from the others. The blackberries were generally more earthy, while many of the raspberries and strawberries had more fruity/berry flavor. Often, multivariate data analysis packages have pretty good defaults built into their packages that you should take advantage of to quickly look at your data.

But it's hard to see what's going on with the blueberries. A lot of the text is impossible to read. And some additional color- or shape-coding with a key would be helpful.

## Basics of Tidy Graphics

If you want to make this look publication-friendly by getting rid of overlapping text, changing font size and color, color-coding your berries, etc, you *can* do this with base R's plotting functions, but it's much easier to use the tidyverse package `ggplot2` to manipulate graphs.

`ggplot2` provides a standardized, programmatic interface for data visualization, in contrast to the piecemeal approach common to base `R` graphics plotting.  This means that, while the syntax itself can be challenging to learn, syntax for different tasks differs in logical and predictable ways and it works well together with other `tidyverse` functions and principles (like `select()` and `filter()`).

The schematic elements of a ggplot are as follows:

```{r non-working schematic of a ggplot, eval = FALSE}
# The ggplot() function creates your plotting environment.  We usually save it to a variable in R so that we can use the plug-n-play functionality of ggplot without retyping a bunch of nonsense
p <- ggplot(mapping = aes(x = <a variable>, y = <another variable>, ...),
            data = <your data>)

# Then, you can add various ways of plotting data to make different visualizations.
p + 
  geom_<your chosen way of plotting>(...) +
  theme_<your chosen theme> +
  ...
```

In graphical form, the following diagram ([from VT Professor JP Gannon](https://vt-hydroinformatics.github.io/Plotting.html#our-first-ggplot)) gives an intuition of what is happening:

![Basic ggplot mappings.  Color boxes indicate where the elements go in the function and in the plot.](img/GGplot syntax.png)

Since ggplot2 is a tidyverse package, we do need to re-tidy the data (and, often, keep reshaping it after that). In general, `ggplot2` works best with data in "long" or "tidy" format, such as that resulting from the output of `pivot_longer()`: one row for every observation or point.

By default, the scatterplot function needs one row per point with one column of coordinates for each axis (normally x and y): By default, the scatterplot function needs one row per point with one column of coordinates for each axis (normally x and y):

``` {r basic ggplot2 scatterplot}
berry_data %>%
  select(`Sample Name`, contains(c("9pt_","lms_","us_"))) %>%
  summarize(across(everything(), ~ mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE)), .by = `Sample Name`) -> berry_average_likings

berry_average_likings %>%
  nrow()

berry_average_likings %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `9pt_overall`, y = `lms_overall`)) +
  geom_point() #23 points, one per row
```

The bar plot and histograph functions take a categorical or binnable numeric variable, respectively, with one row per observation that they will *count*. These do some summarizing work and draw one bar per *group*, although you can override this behavior.

```{r }
#geom_bar() is for when you already have discrete data, it just counts:
berry_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = cata_taste_berry)) +
  geom_bar()

berry_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `9pt_overall`)) +
  geom_bar()

#and geom_histogram() is for continuous data, it counts and bins:
berry_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `lms_overall`)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

Like many things today, you can make infinitely-complicated graphs using these same basic semantics. `ggplot2`, especially, is a world of exceptions! You could eventually end up having to do something like this, where each `geom_*` has a totally different dataset:

```{r}
#insert a horrible ggplot() call with different data for different geoms.

```

We will not be doing that today. But if you ever find yourself tearing your hair out over a complicated plot, remember this section.

## Better CA plots with ggplot2

We need to think about what we want to plot. The CA maps are **scatterplots** where each point is a **sample** (row variable) or **attribute** (column variable). These coordinates are in the list that the `ca()` function outputs, but in two separate matrices. We already learned how to combine them into *one* where the columns are *axes* and the rows are the *variables* from our initial dataset, with a column specifying whether each row is a sample or an attribute variable.

```{r }
berry_ca_coords
```

This will get us pretty far.

``` {r a basic ca map with ggplot2}
berry_ca_coords %>%
  mutate(Variable = str_remove(Variable, "cata_")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Dim1, y = Dim2, color = Type, label = Variable)) +
  geom_hline(color="black", yintercept = 0) +
  geom_vline(color="black", xintercept = 0) +
  geom_text_repel() +
  theme_bw() +
  xlab("Dimension 1") +
  ylab("Dimension 2")
```

```{r}

berry_cata_ca$sv %>%
  {str_c("Dimension ", 1:length(.), " (", round(100 * .^2 / sum(.^2), 1), "% Inertia)")} ->
  berry_cata_ca_dimnames

berry_ca_std_coords_tidy %>%
  mutate(Variable = str_remove(Variable, "cata_"),
         Variable = str_replace(Variable, "Strawberry", "Strawberry "),
         font = ifelse(Type == "Attribute", "italic", "plain")) %>%
  separate(Variable, c("Var_Major", "Var_Minor"), remove = FALSE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Dim1, y = Dim2, fontface = font, color = Var_Major, label = Variable)) +
  geom_hline(color="black", yintercept = 0) +
  geom_vline(color="black", xintercept = 0) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel(size = 5) +
  theme_bw() +
  xlab(berry_cata_ca_dimnames[1]) +
  ylab(berry_cata_ca_dimnames[2]) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("appearance" = "#bababa",
                                "taste" = "#7f7f7f",
                                "Blackberry" = "#2d0645",
                                "Blueberry" = "#3e17e8",
                                "raspberry" = "#7a1414",
                                "Strawberry" = "#f089cb"))

```














## Your first `ggplot()`

Our beer data is already relatively tidy, so we will begin by making an example `ggplot()` to demonstrate how it works.

```{r a first ggplot}
berry_data %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = lms_appearance, y = lms_overall)) + # Here we set up the base plot
  geom_point()                           # Here we tell our base plot to add points
```

This doesn't look all that impressive--partly because the data being plotted itself isn't that sensible, and partly because we haven't made many changes.  But before we start looking into that, let's break down the parts of this command.

## The `aes()` function and `mapping = ` argument

The `ggplot()` function takes two arguments that are essential, as well as some others you'll rarely use.  The first, `data = `, is straightforward, and you'll usually be passing data to the function at the end of some pipeline using `%>%`

The second, `mapping = `, is less clear.  This argument requires the `aes()` function, which can be read as the "aesthetic" function.  The way that this function works is quite complex, and really not worth digging into here, but I understand it in my head as **telling `ggplot()` what part of my data is going to connect to what part of the plot**.  So, if we write `aes(x = rating)`, we can read this in our heads as "the values of x will be mapped from the 'rating' column". 

This sentence tells us the other important thing about `ggplot()` and the `aes()` mappings: **mapped variables each have to be in their own column**.  This is another reason that `ggplot()` requires tidy data. 

## Adding layers with `geom_*()` functions

In the above example, we added (literally, using `+`) a function called `geom_point()` to the base `ggplot()` call.  This is functionally a "layer" of our plot, that tells `ggplot2` how to actually visualize the elements specified in the `aes()` function--in the case of `geom_point()`, we create a point for each row's combination of `x = rating` and `y = overall`.

```{r what we are plotting in this example}
berry_data %>%
  select(lms_appearance, lms_overall) %>%
  drop_na()
```

There are many `geom_*()` functions in `ggplot2`, and many others defined in other accessory packages.  These are the heart of visualizations.  We can swap them out to get different results:

```{r changing the geom changes the way the data map, fig.cap = 'switching geom_() switches the way the data map'}
berry_data %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = lms_appearance, y = lms_overall)) + 
  geom_smooth()
```
Here we fit a smoothed line to our data using the default methods in `geom_smooth()` (which in this case heuristically defaults to a General Additive Model).

We can also combine layers, as the term implies:

```{r geoms are layers in a plot, fig.cap = 'geom_()s are layers in a plot'}
berry_data %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = lms_appearance, y = lms_overall)) + 
  geom_jitter() + # add some random noise to show overlapping points
  geom_smooth()
```

Note that we don't need to tell *either* `geom_smooth()` or `geom_jitter()` what `x` and `y` are--they "inherit" them from the `ggplot()` function to which they are added (`+`), which defines the plot itself.

What other arguments can be set to aesthetics?  Well, we can set other visual properties like **color**, **size**, **transparency** (called "alpha"), and so on.  For example, let's try to look at whether there is a relationship between ABV and perceived quality.

```{r here are some other parts of the plot we can control with data}
beer_data %>%
  # mutate a new variable for plotting
  mutate(high_abv = ifelse(abv > 9, "yes", "no")) %>%
  drop_na(high_abv) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = rating, y = overall, color = high_abv)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 1/4) + 
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  theme_bw()
```

We can see that most of the yellow "yes" dots are in the top right of the figure--people rate more alcoholic beer as higher quality for both `overall` and `rating`.

## Arguments inside and outside of `aes()`

In the last plot, we saw an example in the `geom_jitter(alpha = 1/4)` function of setting the `alpha` (transparency) aesthetic element directly, without using `aes()` to **map** a variable to this aesthetic.  That is why this is not wrapped in the `aes()` function.  In `ggplot2`, this is how we set aesthetics to fixed values.  Alternatively, we could have mapped this to a variable, just like color:

```{r using the aes function, fig.cap = 'using the aes() function'}
beer_data %>%
  drop_na(abv) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = rating, y = overall)) + 
  # We can set new aes() mappings in individual layers, as well as the plot itself
  geom_jitter(aes(alpha = abv)) + 
  theme_bw()
```

As an aside, we can see the same relationship noted above: higher ABV is associated with higher ratings.

### Using `theme_*()` to change visual options quickly

In the last several plots, notice that we have changed from the default (and to my mind unattractive) grey background of `ggplot2` to a black and white theme.  This is by adding a `theme_bw()` call to the list of commands.  `ggplot2` includes a number of default `theme_*()` functions, and you can get many more through other `R` packages.  They can have subtle to dramatic effects:

```{r using the theme functions, fig.cap = 'using the theme_*() functions'}
beer_data %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = rating, y = overall)) + 
  geom_jitter() + 
  theme_void()
```

You can also edit every last element of the plot's theme using the base `theme()` function, which is powerful but a little bit tricky to use.

### Changing aesthetic elements with `scale_*()` functions

Finally, say we didn't like the default color set for the points.  

How can we manipulate the colors that are plotted?  The **way in which** mapped, aesthetic variables are assigned to visual elements is controlled by the `scale_*()` functions.  In my experience, the most frequently encountered scales are those for color: either `scale_fill_*()` for solid objects (like the bars in a histogram) or `scale_color_*()` for lines and points (like the outlines of the histogram bars).  

Scale functions work by telling `ggplot()` *how* to map aesthetic variables to visual elements.  You may have noticed that I added a `scale_color_viridis_d()` function to the end of the ABV plot.  This function uses the `viridis` package, which has color-blind and (theoretically) print-safe color scales.


```{r ggplots are R objects}
p <- 
  beer_data %>%
  # This block gets us a subset of beer styles for clear visualization
  group_by(style) %>%
  nest(data = -style) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  slice_sample(n = 10) %>%
  unnest(everything()) %>%
  # And now we can go back to plotting
  ggplot(aes(x = rating, group = style)) + 
  # Density plots are smoothed histograms
  geom_density(aes(fill = style), alpha = 1/4, color = NA) +
  theme_bw()

p
```

We can take a saved plot (like `p`) and use scales to change how it is visualized.

```{r we can modify stored plots after the fact}
p + scale_fill_viridis_d()
```

`ggplot2` has a broad range of built-in options for scales, but there are many others available in add-on packages that build on top of it.  You can also build your own scales using the `scale_*_manual()` functions, in which you give a vector of the same length as your mapped aesthetic variable in order to set up the visual assignment.  That sounds jargon-y, so here is an example:

```{r another example of posthoc plot modification}
# We'll pick 14 random colors from the colors R knows about
random_colors <- print(colors()[sample(x = 1:length(colors()), size = 10)])

p + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = random_colors)
```

### Finally, `facet_*()`

The last powerful tool I want to show off is the ability of `ggplot2` to make what[ Edward Tufte called "small multiples"](https://socviz.co/groupfacettx.html#facet-to-make-small-multiples): breaking out the data into multiple, identical plots by some categorical classifier in order to show trends more effectively.

So far we've seen how to visualize ratings in our beer data by ABV and by style.  We could combine these in one plot by assigning ABV to one aesthetic, style to another, and so on.  But our plots might get messy.  Instead, let's see how we can break out, for example, different ABVs into different, "small multiple" facet plots to get a look at trends in liking.

A plausible sensory hypothesis is that the `palate` variable in particular will change by ABV.  So we are going to take a couple steps here:

1.  We will use `mutate()` to split `abv` into low, medium, and high (using tertile splits)
3.  We will plot the relationship of `palate` to ABV as a density plot
3.  We will then look at this as a single plot vs a facetted plot

```{r starting with a base plot showing palate tertiles}
p <- 
  beer_data %>%
  # Step 1: make abv tertiles
  mutate(abv_tertile = as.factor(ntile(abv, 3))) %>%
  # Step 2: plot
  ggplot(aes(x = palate, group = abv_tertile)) + 
  geom_density(aes(fill = abv_tertile), 
              alpha = 1/4, color = NA, adjust = 3) + 
  theme_classic()

# Unfacetted plot
p
```

It looks like the expected trend is present, but it's a bit hard to see.  Let's see what happens if we break this out into "facets":

```{r splitting the plot into 3 small multiples, fig.cap = 'now we split the plot into 3 "small multiples" with facet_wrap()'}
p + 
  facet_wrap(~abv_tertile, nrow = 4) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

By splitting into facets we can see that there is much more density towards the higher `palate` ratings for the higher `abv` tertiles.  This may help explain the positive relationship between `abv` and `rating` in the overall dataset: the consumers in this sample clearly appreciate the mouthfeel associated with higher alcohol contents.
