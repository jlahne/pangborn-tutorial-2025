## Introduction
In order to be prepared to participate for the in-person tutorial on publication-quality graphics in the tidyverse, you should bring a laptop that has the following installed:
- `R` (version 4.1.0 or newer)
- RStudio (version 2022.07.0 or newer)
- The `R` packages:
  - **tidyverse**
  - **FactoMineR**
  - **ggrepel**
  - **ca**
- The tutorial materials from our [GitHub](https://github.com/lhami/sensometrics-r-tutorial-2024/blob/main/code/sensometrics-2024-code-download.zip)

You may need help or pre-approval from your IT department if you will be using a work laptop. You should install all of these pieces of software and run the test code **before you travel** to minimize the setup necessary at the start of the tutorial.

If you would prefer to see all of the setup instructions at once, you can go to [the github repo for this tutorial](https://github.com/lhami/sensometrics-r-tutorial-2024?tab=readme-ov-file#setup-for-this-tutorial-do-this-before-you-travel).

If you get stuck or need any help, email us at **jlahne at vt dot edu** and **lhamilton at vsu dot edu**.

## Installing R
You will need the free, open-source statistical programming language `R` installed to participate in the tutorial. This should be possible even on "managed" work computers--you can install `R` to your local profile without admin credentials.

If you have never used `R` on this computer before, install the newest version of `R` from [the CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/):

![](https://vimeo.com/203516510)

If you are using a work-managed Windows computer, you may see a screen that looks like this:
[A windows user account control prompt asking for administrator credentials to run a program.](img/uac-asks-password-admin.png){width=400px}
You can safely select "No" and proceed through local installation.

*If* you already have `R` on your computer, run `sessionInfo()` in the `R` console to make sure you are using version 4.1.0 or newer. The **tidyverse** is only compatible with versions of `R` from the last few years, and there are major updates periodically. You can have more than one version of `R` installed on one computer, although [keeping multiple versions of packages installed to go with it is more challenging and may require additional tools](https://scientifictools.org/article/12-is-it-possible-to-install-multiple-versions-of-r/).

### Setup check: R
Open your new copy of `R` and paste this code into the console:

`sessionInfo()$R.version$major`

Press the enter key to run the code.

```{r r-check echo=FALSE}
question("What does the R console return when you run the above code?",
         answer("1"),
         answer("2"),
         answer("3"),
         answer("4", correct = TRUE),
         answer("5", message = "Woah! As far as we know, R version 5 isn't available yet. Make sure you run the code exactly as we typed it. If you did, email us for help."),
         incorrect = "You need R version 4.1.0 or newer for this tutorial. Please go to CRAN and install a new version of R.",
         allow_retry = TRUE)
```

## RStudio
While you *can* do everything that we'll be demonstrating directly in the `R` console, as you did for the last question, it is difficult to keep track of your scripts, manage files, and preview plots with the regular `R` interface. We will be using **RStudio** to make this faster and easier. Unless you are already very comfortable with `R`, we recommend downloading RStudio.

RStudio is an "**I**nteractive **D**evelopment **E**nvironment" (IDE) for working with `R`. Without going into a lot of detail, that means that `R` lives on its own on your computer in a separate directory, and RStudio provides a bunch of better functionality for things like writing multiple files at once, making editing easier, autofilling code, and displaying plots.

### Downloading RStudio
Download the free version of [RStudio Desktop from the Posit website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download)

![](https://vimeo.com/203516968)

If you are using a work-managed Windows computer, you may get stuck at a screen that looks like this:
[A windows user account control prompt asking for administrator credentials to run a program.](img/uac-asks-password-admin.png){width=400px}

Unfortunately, you do need a system administrator to approve the RStudio installer on Windows PCs. If you are in this situation, reach out to your IT person **now** and ask them if RStudio is approved software and how to download it.

As a backup, you can create a [Free Posit Cloud Account](https://posit.cloud/plans) to use RStudio through your internet browser. This account is limited and requires an active internet connection, but it will allow you to complete the tutorial exercises as long as the conference wi-fi is working as expected.

### Changing your RStudio settings
Open RStudio. Look at the top menu, which starts with `File`, then `Edit`.

Navigate through this menu to `Tools > Global Options`.

Uncheck all the boxes that have to do with restoring projects and workspaces, so it matches this screenshot:
![Uncheck the options to restore various data and projects at startup.](img/global-options-settings.png){width=400px}

You can see from the lefthand box that this was the `General` tab of the Global Options. Navigate to `Code > Completion` and select the checkboxes to allow using `tab` for autocompletions and allowing multiline autocompletions, as shown below:
![Check the boxes for tab and multiline autocompletions.](img/code-autocompletion.png){width=400px}

### Setup check: RStudio
Keep R or RStudio open. You will need it for the rest of this tutorial.

```{r rstudio-check echo=FALSE}
question("Which of the following are headings under the `Code > Editing` tab of the RStudio Global Options? Check all that apply.",
         answer("Editing", correct = TRUE),
         answer("Execution", correct = TRUE),
         answer("Snippets", correct = TRUE),
         answer("Other Languages"),
         answer("R and C/C++"),
         answer("Workspace"),
         answer("History"),
         incorrect = "Make sure you look at the `Code > Editing` tab in your own RStudio download. The screenshots in this tutorial are of different settings tabs.",
         type = "multiple",
         random_answer_order = TRUE,
         allow_retry = TRUE)
```

## Installing R Packages
Keep R or RStudio open. You need to install the packages:
- **tidyverse**
- **FactoMineR**
- **ggrepel**
- **ca**

You can do this by pasting the following code into the R(Studio) console:

`install.packages(c("tidyverse", "FactoMineR", "ggrepel", "ca"))`

Hit the enter key on your keyboard to run.

### Setup check: R packages



## Code for this tutorial

We recommend that you download the pre-made archive of code and data from the [workshop github repo](https://github.com/lhami/sensometrics-tutorial-2024).  This archive, when unzipped, will have a folder structure and a `.Rproj` file.  We recommend that you close out RStudio, unzip the archive, and double click the `.Rproj` file *in that folder*, which will open a new session of RStudio with proper setting (like the home directory) for the files for this workshop.

In that folder, you will find a `data/` folder with the necessary data for the workshop, and a script named `sensometrics-all-code.R`.  This latter file contains all of the code demonstrated in this workshop for your future reference.  You can also follow along with the code at the [workshop's page hosted on github.io](https://lhami.github.io/sensometrics-tutorial-2024) (which you're reading right now), and which will remain available after this workshop.

Once you're in RStudio, go to the `File > New File > R Script` menu to open a new script.  We'll talk about how these work in a minute, but this is basically a workbook for you to store sequential lines of code to be run in the `Console`.  It is where you can livecode along!  Even though we are giving you all of the code you need right now, you will learn a lot more if you actively follow along, rather than just run that code.

## Summary
###

<!-- Two to four sentences which bring the lessons of the tutorial together for the student. What do they know now that they did not know before? How does this tutorial connect to other tutorials? OK if this is very similar to the Introduction. You made a promise as to what they would learn. You (we hope!) kept that promise.-->
